## Installation

To install `pyaws_cui`, use pip:

```
pip install pyaws-cui

pyaws
```

Since `py_cui` is a dependency for this application, it will be installed as well. As noted by their documentation, if the user is on a windows machine, `windows-curses`, a `curses` emulator, will also be installed.

#### Build from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/j-lavender/pyaws_cui.git
cd pyaws_cui
pip install .
```
